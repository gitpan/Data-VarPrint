DESCRIPTION
    Data::VarPrint module contains two functions: VarPrint and
    VarPrintAsString.

    structured, so that complex structures (combinations of hash and array
    references) are presented in a way which makes them easy to read.

    Function VarPrintAsString returns the same output as a string, which can
    be usefull with error logs.

OPTIONS
    VarPrint and VarPrintAsString take list of variables as arguments.
